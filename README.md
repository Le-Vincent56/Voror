### Game Description

-   Vörðr is a game based on Vikings and Old Norse Mythology, where a Viking attempts to protect his village from the monsters of Hel. You play as Viggo, the guardian of the village Toft as the Rift of Hel as tore open. As most of the vikings have been sent to the frontline of the Rift, you were left behind to protect the rest of the village. Protect the villagers while fending off the mosnter of Hel and see if you were to be the destined defender of not only Toft, but the world.

## Your Additions

-   A mechanic of protecting a number of villagers from the monsters, adding both a bonus to the score depending on how many villagers are alive, as well as another type of lose condition besides health; you can lose if all the villagers die.
-   A melee attack that allows the player to get close and personal with the monsters and deal an area-of-effect attack, alongside the traditional projectiles that fit the SHMUP genre.
-   The effects of Sigils, or power-ups that allow for temporary boosts for the player, such as a speed-up and faster shooting and slashing. Sigils might also invoke the power of gods, such as striking an area with Thor's lightning, removing monsters within that area.
